# Upcycle
## Purpose
Upcyle is an application that allows users to post items they no longer want instead of throwing them away.  
The items are then claimed by other users for only the cost of shipping.  
Once an account is created, users can list their items and also find new-to-them items to help restrict waste and make the world a little greener.
